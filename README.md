This project contains a kalman filter to deduce position and velocity (2x1 state vector) from a pre-defined series of measurements. 

The Eigen library is utilized for matrix operations. (I highly recommend it!)

For the curious mind, I have annotated the code with descriptions on every step of the Kalman Filtering process.
